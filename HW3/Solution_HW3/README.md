for part one my plan was to keep a state variable so I know whether the user is entering the first number or the second number or if a calculation has been done already.  

for the snake game part i used html canvase and the timer function to continually draw a straight red line and have it bend left and right when the respective buttons are pressed.

However I couldn't get the snake game to work properly so I just submitted what I had.
